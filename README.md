## Week 7 - To do challenge

The goal is to create a simple front-end To-do list following given user stories:

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice
```

Technologies used:

* AngularJS as a front-end framework
* Bootstrap for page styling
* Karma (running PhantomJS) with Jasmine for unit testing
* Protractor (running webdriver) with Jasmine for acceptance testing


How to use the package:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the following commands
```bash
npm install
bower install
```
3. Run the unit tests
```bash
grunt test
```
